This is a Library app where you can checkout a book, return a book, make it as over due, and show all of the books in the library.

This was project 6 in my CS120 course.

The library is a text file which contains currently 25 book titles, and their authors. The app reads from this file and stores it in memory.

To run this app:

1. Fork the repository
2. Open it in Eclipse
3. Copy the path of libraryHoldings.txt in relation to the structure of this repo it is located at /src/librayHoldings.txt
4. Open Proj6App.java and paste the path copied in step 3 on line 21 where instructed to do so.
5. Run the app and enjoy!
